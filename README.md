# NoFecBox
NoFecBox is a device developed to deliver disposable masks and hand sanitizer at establishments, without needing direct contact, aiming at everyone's protection and safety in the face of Covid-19 pandemic. The device was a group work as the final project to the subject of Introduction to Computer Engineering at UFPB (Universidade Federal da Paraíba).

The circuit was built with Arduino and the structure with MDF boards. We used reusable small plastic balls as compartments to keep the masks in it.

   * 1 transparent hose (diameter de 4,5mm) - R$ 5,00;
   * 20 jumpers - R$ 5,00;
   * 1 plastic bottles - R$ 1,00.

* **Masks dispenser's materials**
   * 1 ultrasonic distance sensor - R$ 10,90;
   * 1 stepper motor (5V) + 1 driver ULN2003 - R$ 19,90;
   * 1 9V battery - R$ 19,90;
   * 1 9V battery connector - R$ 3,90;
   * 20 jumpers - R$ 5,00;

* **General materials**
   * 1 Arduíno Mega - R$ 75,00;
   * 1 LCD display 16x2 - R$ 15,00;
   * 1 breadboard (400 pontos) - R$ 11,00;
   * 1 resistor 330 Ohms - R$ 0,05;
   * 1 resistor 1k Ohms - R$ 0,05;
   * 1 potentiometer - R$ 1,50;
   * 1 9V battery - R$ 19,90;
   * 1 9V battery connector - R$ 3,90;
   * 1 pushbutton - R$ 0,05;
   * 37 jumpers - R$ 10,00;
   * MDF structure - R$ 135,00.

## Budget
Type|Price
---|---
Total hand sanitizer dispenser|R$ 53,90
Total masks dispenser|R$ 59,60
Total general|R$ 271,45
**Total budget**|R$ 384,95

## Running
Finally, to use the device you just have to approach your hands next to the sensors. The small ball comes out with a mask inside it and the hand sanitizer is ejected out of the hose.
